Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects. In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn the basics of object-oriented programming in Python.

Conceptually, objects are like the components of a system. Think of a program as a factory assembly line of sorts. At each step of the assembly line, a system component processes some material, ultimately transforming raw material into a finished product.

An object contains data, like the raw or preprocessed materials at each step on an assembly line. In addition, the object contains behavior, like the action that each assembly line component performs

What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.

For example, an object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Or it could represent an email with properties like a recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending.

Classes allow you to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.
